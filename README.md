# Exploratory and Predictive Analysis in Media Retail

## Project Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of digital media store database - The Chinook Database - containing information about employees, customers, purchases, and media tracks. The objective is to derive insights into customer behavior, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance decision-making processes through detailed data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning.

## Contents
- **SQL Queries**: Scripts to explore and manipulate data directly within the database, focusing on customer preferences, purchase patterns, and revenue generation.
- **Data Analysis**: Notebooks and scripts that perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various machine learning techniques to predict customer lifetime value, churn, and segment customers effectively.

## Key Features
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior and preferences to tailor marketing efforts.
- **CLV Prediction**: Employ regression models to forecast the Customer Lifetime Value and allocate marketing resources efficiently.
- **Churn Analysis**: Utilize classification models to predict the likelihood of customers discontinuing their purchases.

## Technologies Used
- **SQLite**: Primary database for managing the Chinook dataset and performing exploratory data analysis.
- **Python**: Major programming language used for data manipulation and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and sharing of results.

## Working demonstration
A working demonstration is provided in the jupyter notebook.
